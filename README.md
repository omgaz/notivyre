NotiVYRE
--------
NotiVYRE was our winning entry for the [VYRE](http://www.vyre.com) internal innovation competition in which I worked on a real-time chat and notification system with [Blanca Garcia](https://github.com/blanquish) and [Matt Roberts](https://github.com/mattcroberts).

Although this code is *not* complete or functional in its current state it serves as a good base for reference for further NodeJS, CoffeScript, Redis and WebSockets projects.
